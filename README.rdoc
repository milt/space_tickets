= Space Tickets

Is a game of deep space IT support, written in Ruby 1.9.3

It uses Gosu and Texplay.

It is in a very early stage of development. Get off my back.

It is completely free to do what you want with, but contains some assets with their own licenses.

To get it going in its current state:

$ git clone git://github.com/milt/space_tickets.git
$ cd space_tickets
$ bundle install
$ ruby bin/space_tickets

== Controls

* Arrow Keys - Move
* Esc - Exit
